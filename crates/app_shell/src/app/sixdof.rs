//! Background reader for a 6-DoF mouse, a six-axis navigation puck.
//!
//! The daemon that owns the device publishes events on a UNIX socket, and the
//! vendor's own driver publishes them through the display server instead; one
//! thread here blocks on whichever answered, so the UI thread never waits on
//! it. The thread reconnects on its own, because a daemon with no device
//! plugged in, or no daemon at all, is an ordinary state, not an error
//! worth reporting. A browser page reads the device's own reports through
//! WebHID instead (`web`), decoded as the crate decodes them elsewhere.
//!
//! The daemon sends a reading only when the puck's deflection *changes*, so
//! the last reading is held until the next one arrives; letting go sends
//! zeroes, which is what stops the motion. The UI thread reads the held value
//! once per frame and integrates it over the frame's duration.
