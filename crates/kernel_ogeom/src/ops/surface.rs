//! Surface steps: sheets made from curves and added to the body beside what
//! is there, and the body's faces sewn, trimmed, split, extended, offset,
//! thickened, rounded (along an edge, or between two faces) or mirrored.
//!
//! A body built from surface steps holds a compound of its sheets (and of
//! the solids sewing or thickening makes). Curves come from sketches (open
//! chains as well as loops), from edges of the body's own shape, or from
//! edges of another body's, carried to where that body sits. Every
//! sheet a step makes is bounded by edges, so the steps after it can pick
//! them and a sew can join it to its neighbours; a fill is bounded by the
//! very edges it was given.
