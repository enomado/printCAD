//! Design's commands: add a feature, or change one, by numbers, for
//! scripts and other callers that are not a click.
//!
//! A feature is made the way its toolbar button makes it, from the sketch
//! and body the call names instead of the selection, with the defaults the
//! button gives; any field of the feature named in the call replaces its
//! default. `pc.doc.feature{id = ...}` shows a feature's fields.
