//! A coupling: two joints' motions tied together, as gears, a belt, a rack
//! and pinion or a screw tie them. Each end is a hinge or a slider; the
//! driven one's travel follows the driving one's by a ratio.
//!
//! A hinge's angle wraps round at a half turn, but a gear train remembers
//! every turn: after a whole turn of a driver at 1:2 the driven gear is half
//! a turn on, not back where it started. So the coupling counts its
//! driver's whole turns (`turns`), and a solve that carries the driver past
//! the wrap moves the count with it.
