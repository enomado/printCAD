//! Workbenches from packages. A package is a WebAssembly component
//! speaking `printcad:workbench` (`bench_api`), a manifest and its icons;
//! [`load`] turns one into a [`WasmWorkbench`], which the registry takes
//! like any built-in bench. See `docs/PLUGINS.md`.

// Packages run under wasmtime on a desktop (`runtime`) and on the page's
// own engine in a browser (`web`); both share the host side and the bench.
