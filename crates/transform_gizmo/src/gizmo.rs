//! Camera-independent transform handles. Geometry is shared by drawing and picking.
//! Hold the camera fixed during a gesture. Apply every delta to the caller's press
//! snapshot, commit on Finished, and restore that snapshot on Cancelled.
//!
//! Space is the host's, in `f64`: the gizmo never sees a floating origin, only the
//! host's [`GizmoView`] that projects and casts rays in it.
//!
//! Arrows end in cones, planar squares translate in a plane, and during a drag the
//! gizmo shows what changes: a ghost of the press position with a dashed travel
//! line and the axis guide for translation, the swept sector for rotation, and the
//! value on a plate next to it. Modes stay separate: one gizmo shows either arrows
//! or rings.
//!
//! Handles come from a list ([`HandleSet`]): each [`HandleSpec`] is one scalar
//! freedom, a slide along or a turn about an arbitrary unit direction, such as one
//! joint of a kinematic chain ([`crate::hand`] turns the delta into joint
//! increments). Translate shows the listed slides (arrows,
//! plus a planar handle for every non-collinear pair), Rotate the listed turns
//! (rings); a freedom that is not listed has no handle and cannot be grabbed.
//! [`HandleSet::placement_axes`] is the classic three-axis gizmo.
//!
//! A frame of a host: [`Gizmo::layout`], [`Layout::hit`] under the pointer, then
//! [`Gizmo::press`] on a press over a handle, or [`Gizmo::drag`] and
//! [`Gizmo::release`] / [`Gizmo::cancel`] while one is held, and
//! [`Gizmo::shapes`] of that layout to draw.
