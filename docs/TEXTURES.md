# Surface textures

A surface texture presses a pattern into a body's faces for printing:
knurling on a grip, ribs, hexagons, a rough finish, or a picture of your
own. The exact solid stays as it is. The texture is drawn in the view and
pressed into the STL and 3MF files you export and the file sent to the
slicer. STEP export writes the solid without it.

## Adding one

Right click a body (in the tree or the view) and pick **Surface
texture…**. The texture starts on the face under the pointer and every
face selected in the view (Ctrl+click picks several); with none, on the
whole body. A new texture is Knurl, Triplanar, a 3 mm tile, 0.4 mm
deep. The task in the right panel shows the changes in the view as you
make them. OK keeps them as one undo step, Cancel puts back what was
there.

- **Faces**: click faces in the view to add them, Ctrl+click for several
  at once. Each listed face has a × to leave it smooth again. **Whole
  body** textures every face.
- **Pattern**: pick one from the gallery, or **Picture…** for a greyscale
  PNG or JPEG, white standing highest. The picture is kept in the document.
- **Projection**: how the flat pattern is laid on the faces, along the
  body's own axes.
  - *Triplanar* blends three flat projections and suits any shape.
  - *Flat along X, Y or Z* projects straight along one axis.
  - *Round X, Y or Z* wraps the pattern round an axis, a whole number of
    tiles round, so it closes without a seam: knurling on a cylinder.
  - *Spherical* wraps round the middle of the textured faces.
- **Tile**: the size of one repeat of the pattern (0.2 to 500 mm).
- **Turn**: the pattern's rotation on the surface.
- **Depth**: how far the pattern's high points stand from the surface
  (up to 20 mm). **Into the surface** cuts it in instead.
- **Keep flat**: faces within this angle (up to 89°) of facing straight
  up or down the body's Z stay smooth, a print's top and the side it
  stands on. 0 textures them too.

A body can carry several textures on different faces: **Add** starts
another, and the Texture 1, Texture 2 labels switch between them.
**Remove this texture** takes the one shown away. A textured body shows
TEXTURED in the tree.

The texture follows its faces through edits: faces are kept by the names
the model gives them, so changing a pad's length keeps the grip knurled.

## Exporting

The export dialog's **Surface textures** switch (on by default, for STL
and 3MF) presses them in. The exported mesh is finer than the view's, and
capped at a few million triangles for very fine patterns on large parts.
Send to slicer always includes them.

## Scripts

`pc.doc.set_textures{body = b, textures = {...}}` sets all of a body's
textures at once; see the command reference in `SCRIPTING.md`. Each
entry's `faces` lists face numbers as `doc.faces` gives them; without it
the texture covers the whole body, and an empty `textures` list takes
them all away.

```lua
pc.doc.set_textures{body = b, textures = {
  {texture = {pattern = "Knurl", projection = {Cylindrical = "Z"},
              tile_mm = 4, depth_mm = 0.8, keep_flat_deg = 10}},
}}
```
