# Surfaces

The Surface workbench makes sheets: surfaces with no inside, built from
curves, joined into shells, and closed into solids. Use it for shapes a
solid feature cannot reach: a car body panel, a mouse shell, a duct, or a
lid whose edge follows a free-form curve.

## Surface bodies

Surface steps go into a surface body: the selected one, or the body of
the selected sketch when that body holds only sketches and datums, or a
new body named Surface otherwise. A Design feature asked for on a
surface body goes into a new body of its own, so the two never build over
each other. To build solid features on a surface model, sew it closed
into a solid and use the body in Design (a body boolean, or borrowing its
shape).

## Curves

A step is built from curves:

- **Sketches.** Every chain of a sketch's curves counts, open or closed.
  An open chain runs from one loose end to the other. A point where three
  curves meet is refused, since no single chain passes it.
- **Edges.** Edges picked in the view (Ctrl adds to the pick): of the
  body's own surfaces, where a fill can close the gap between surfaces,
  or of any other body, a Design solid too, taken where that body sits.
  A step on another body's edge builds again when that body changes or
  moves. Two bodies may not each read the other's edges.
- **A face's edges.** A face picked in the view gives every edge round it
  at once (a seam left out) to the tools that take curves or edges in any
  number: extruded, revolved and planar surfaces, filling, extending and
  the surface fillet.

A sketch a new step reads is hidden, the surface standing in for it
(Preferences › Surface turns this off).

Create sketch starts a sketch in the selected surface body (or a new
one); finishing it comes back to Surface with the sketch selected, ready
for a tool. The tools that build from curves stay dim until a sketch is
selected in the tree or edges or a face are picked; Sew and Mirror until a surface
body with a shape is selected, and Check continuity, the curvature map
and zebra stripes until any body with a shape is. A tool takes what is selected when it is clicked; in its task,
"Add the selection" takes what is selected now, and the cross by a row
takes it out.

## Making surfaces

| Tool | What it makes |
| --- | --- |
| Extruded surface | Each curve swept straight: square to its sketch, or along X, Y or Z; one way, reversed, or half each way. A curve running along the direction sweeps nothing, and the step says so. |
| Revolved surface | Each curve turned about an axis: the sketch's vertical or horizontal axis, or X, Y or Z. |
| Planar surface | The flat face closed loops bound, a loop inside another a hole; or the face picked edges closing a flat loop bound. |
| Filling | The surface curves meeting end to end bound, three or more. A side picked on a surface meets that surface touching (G0), tangent (G1) or curvature continuous (G2); a sketch's curve is touched. |
| Ruled surface | Straight lines between two curves, end to end, one face per pair of pieces. |
| Lofted surface | A surface through section curves, one per sketch, in order; closed back to the first if asked. Guide curves, each crossing every section once, shape it between the sections. |
| Swept surface | A profile moved along a path, straight or curved, turning with it, from the end of the path the profile sits by. With a second rail, the profile runs from the path to the rail and rides both, scaled to the width between them. |
| Offset surface | Picked faces copied at a distance along their normals. |
| Blend surface | A surface bridging two picked edges, meeting each edge's face touching, tangent or curvature continuous. |

Every surface is bounded by edges: a later step can pick them, and Sew
joins it to its neighbours. A filling is bounded by the very edges it was
given.

## Working on surfaces

| Tool | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Sew | Joins the body's surfaces where their edges meet, or come within a gap you set. A shell that closes becomes a solid. |
| Surface fillet | Rounds picked edges where two faces of a surface meet. |
| Fillet between surfaces | Rounds between two picked faces that share no edge, such as two separate surfaces: each is cut back to where the round touches it, and the three become one sheet. The round rolls on the side each face's normal points to; flip a face to roll it on the other. |
| Extend surface | Grows faces past picked edges: on their own surface (G2), straight on tangent (G1), or straight on (G0). |
| Split surface | Cuts picked faces along curves: a sketch lands on the face as seen square to its plane, and must cross the face from edge to edge. |
| Trim by plane | Keeps what of the body lies on one side of a plane. |
| Thicken | Gives each of the body's sheets a thickness, one way or half each way: a solid apiece. |
| Mirror | Adds the body's reflection in the YZ, XZ or XY plane, moved by an offset. |

## Checking how faces meet

Check continuity measures every edge where two faces of the selected body
meet, a surface body or a solid: the gap between them, the angle of the
crease (none where they meet tangent), and how far apart their curvatures
are square to the edge. Each edge is labelled in the view: G2 where the
faces meet tangent and bend alike, G1 for a tangent join whose curvature
jumps (a flat wall running into a round), the crease angle, or the gap
where the faces are apart; the task lists them from the sharpest crease
down. Close puts the labels away.

The curvature map paints the selected body by how sharply its surfaces
bend, read from the exact surfaces at every point of its mesh: the
Gaussian curvature (positive on a dome or in a bowl, negative on a
saddle, nothing on a plane or on what unrolls flat, such as a cylinder),
the mean, or the largest or smallest, which are negative where a surface
bulges out and positive in a hollow; the colours run from the low end
through green at none to the high end, reaching their ends at the range
the task sets, by default the size most of the body stays within.

Zebra stripes paint the body with bands of the way its surfaces face,
turned about X, Y or Z. Across a crease the stripes break; across a
tangent join they run on but bend sharply; across a curvature continuous
join they run on smoothly. The task sets the number of stripes and their
axis. Either display stays until its task closes.

## When a step fails

The body shows its history up to the step that fails, the error is on
that step, and the steps after it say they were not built. Fix or
suppress the failing step and the rest build again.

## Scripting

Every tool that builds has a command: `pc.surface.extrude`,
`pc.surface.revolve`, `pc.surface.planar`, `pc.surface.fill`,
`pc.surface.ruled`, `pc.surface.loft`, `pc.surface.sweep`,
`pc.surface.offset`, `pc.surface.blend`, `pc.surface.sew`,
`pc.surface.fillet`, `pc.surface.fillet_faces`, `pc.surface.extend`, `pc.surface.split`,
`pc.surface.trim`, `pc.surface.thicken` and `pc.surface.mirror`. They
take `sketches` (a list, in order), `body` (a body, or any feature in it)
and any field of the step by name; the steps that work on a body's
surfaces, and Offset and Blend, which read its faces and edges, need
`body`. Sew takes `body` and `gap`, Mirror `body`, `plane` and `offset`.
A step missing what it builds from is refused, naming the field. Each
command's notes and a working example are in the scripting reference.

`pc.surface.set{feature = id, length = 8}` changes a step after it is
made, its curves too (`sketches`); `pc.surface.check{body = id}` returns
how the body's faces meet at each shared edge (`point`, `gap`,
`angle_deg`, `curvature`, `join`) and labels them in the view;
`pc.surface.curvature{body = id, measure = "mean"}` paints the curvature
map and returns its range, `pc.surface.zebra{body = id}` the stripes; `pc.sketch.new{body = id}`
starts a sketch in a surface body, as Create sketch does.

```lua
local s = pc.sketch.new{plane = "XY"}
pc.sketch.polyline{sketch = s, points = {{0, 0}, {10, 0}, {10, 10}, {0, 10}}, closed = true}
local walls = pc.surface.extrude{sketches = {s}, length = 5}
pc.surface.planar{body = walls, sketches = {s}}
pc.surface.sew{body = walls}
```
