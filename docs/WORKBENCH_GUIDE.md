# Writing a workbench

A workbench is a crate that implements `core_document::Workbench`. The
application never refers to a workbench by name. Everything a workbench
shows, draws, picks, rebuilds or asks for goes through this trait and the
workbench registry (`DocumentService`).

Design (`crates/workbenches/wb_design`), the Sketcher
(`crates/workbenches/wb_sketch`), Surface and Assembly are complete
examples. This guide is for a built-in workbench; one installed as a
package is written against the guest SDK instead ([Workbench
packages](PLUGINS.md)).

## 1. Create the crate

```toml
[package]
name = "wb_mine"

[features]
default = ["egui"]
egui = ["core_document/egui", "dep:egui", "dep:ui_kit"]

[dependencies]
core_document = { path = "../../core_document" }
kernel_api = { workspace = true }
serde = { workspace = true }
serde_json = { workspace = true }
egui = { workspace = true, optional = true }
ui_kit = { path = "../../ui_kit", optional = true }
```

The `egui` feature enables the panel methods. Panel code takes colours and
sizes from `ui_kit::tokens`, never as literal values.

Add it to the workspace members and to the `workbenches` crate's
dependencies, then register it in `crates/workbenches/src/lib.rs`:

```rust
core_document::define_workbenches!(
    SketchWorkbench,
    DesignWorkbench,
    SurfaceWorkbench,
    AssemblyWorkbench,
    MyWorkbench
);
```

The order matters. A new document opens in the first workbench that is not
modal, and Preferences lists workbench pages in this order. The switcher
and menus sort by label.

## 2. Describe the workbench

```rust
fn descriptor(&self) -> WorkbenchDescriptor {
    WorkbenchDescriptor::new("wb.mine", "Mine", "What it is for.")
        .icon("workbench-mine")
        .feature_kinds(["wb.mine"])
}
```

- `icon` names an icon in `ui_kit::icon`. Add icons with
  `scripts/vendor-icons.mjs`.
- `feature_kinds` lists the feature kinds this workbench owns. The owner
  draws, picks, edits and deletes features of those kinds. Each kind can
  have one owner only; registration fails otherwise. Design also owns
  `core.datum`.
- `.modal()` marks an editing session, like the Sketcher. Entering it
  remembers the previous workbench, and leaving returns there.

## 3. Add tools

`configure` runs once and registers the tools:

```rust
fn configure(&self, context: &mut WorkbenchContext) {
    context.register_tool(
        ToolDescriptor::new_action("mine.thing", "Thing", Some("shape")).icon("thing").row(1),
    );
}
```

- Row 0 shares the standard toolbar row. Rows 1 and 2 belong to the
  workbench. The workbench menu lists tools by category.
- `new_action`, `new_radio_group` and `new_check` choose how the button
  behaves. `.variants(..)` adds a dropdown.
- `.planned(note)` shows a disabled button for a designed tool that is not
  built yet.
- `is_tool_enabled` and `tool_toggled` are called every frame.
- Clicking an action tool calls `on_input` with
  `WorkbenchInputEvent::ToolActivated`. Return `InputResult::consumed()`
  when handled.

## 4. Add keyboard shortcuts

A tool gets a default key with `.shortcut`. Pressing it while the
workbench is active works like clicking the tool's button:

```rust
ToolDescriptor::new("mine.line", "Line", Some("draw")).shortcut("L")
```

For a key that is not a tool, register an action. Its key sends
`WorkbenchInputEvent::Action { id }` to `on_input`:

```rust
context.register_action(
    ActionDescriptor::new("mine.flip", "Flip direction").shortcut("Shift+F"),
);
```

- Keys are written like `L`, `Shift+F`, `Ctrl+Alt+K` or `F5`. A key that
  does not parse panics at registration, so a typo shows up in tests.
- Users can change every key in Preferences › Keyboard. Ids are saved as
  they are, so keep them stable.
- A workbench's keys work only while it is active, and win over the
  application's keys there.
- Keys without Ctrl or Alt are left to text fields while one has focus.
- The application uses 0 to 6, O, P, F, Shift+F, H, F2, Space,
  Shift+Space and Delete without Ctrl or Alt. A workbench key on one of
  them hides it while the workbench is active.
- A workbench that takes typed numbers from the viewport returns `true`
  from `takes_numeric_input` meanwhile, so the digit keys, `.`, `,` and
  `-` reach it rather than their shortcuts.
- To name a key in a hint, implement `shortcuts_changed`. It receives the
  keys in effect by id at start and after every change.

## 5. Add commands

A command is something a script can call by name, with named arguments.
Register it in `configure` and run it in `run_command`:

```rust
context.register_command(
    CommandSpec::new("mine.slab", "Add a slab")
        .param("width", ParamKind::Number, "In millimetres")
        .optional("name", ParamKind::String, "Its name in the tree")
        .returns("the feature's id"),
);

fn run_command(&mut self, id: &str, args: &CommandArgs, ctx: &mut WorkbenchRuntimeContext) -> CommandResult {
    let a = Args(args);
    match id {
        "mine.slab" => {
            let width = a.number("width")?;
            let made: FeatureId = todo!("add a {width} mm slab to ctx.document");
            Ok(json!(made.0.to_string()))
        }
        _ => Err(CommandError::Unknown(id.to_string())),
    }
}
```

- The host checks the arguments against the spec before the call.
- A command changes the document through its mutators, so the change is
  undoable like a click. It never opens a task or waits for input.
- `.read_only()` marks one that changes nothing (an AI agent never waits
  for approval to run it); `.agent_always_asks()` and
  `.agent_never(reason)` restrict what an agent may do with it.
- A tool or panel action that ends in what a command does calls
  `ctx.record(id, args, result)`, so recordings and scripts see the same
  call.
- Ids are unique across the application; registration fails on a
  duplicate.
- Scripts reach it as `pc.mine.slab{width = 20}`.

A command that takes a file as `path` can also serve File › Import.
Register the file kind beside it:

```rust
context.register_import(FileImport::new("Slab drawing", ["slab"], "mine.import"));
```

- The import dialog offers the extensions, and a picked file with one of
  them runs the command with `path` set, recorded as that command.
- A feature id the command answers is selected in the tree.
- Registration fails when the command is not one the workbench registers.

## 6. Store features

Define a type implementing `WorkbenchFeature` (see
[Document model](DOCUMENT_MODEL.md)) and add it with
`ctx.document.add_feature_in_body(feature, name, body)`.

For each kind it owns, the workbench answers these:

```rust
/// Icon and labels for the tree row.
fn feature_info(&self, node: &FeatureNode) -> FeatureInfo;

/// What to draw for the feature when it is visible and not being edited.
/// `node_revision(node)` gives a revision that changes with the data;
/// `region` (a `PassiveRegion`: a profile and an opacity) has the host
/// shade what the lines enclose.
fn passive_geometry(&self, doc: &Document, id: FeatureId, node: &FeatureNode)
    -> Option<PassiveGeometry>;

/// Distance in pixels from the cursor to the feature, if close enough.
fn pick_feature(&self, doc: &Document, id: FeatureId, node: &FeatureNode, pick: &ViewportPick)
    -> Option<f32>;

/// Remove the feature and fix up what depended on it.
/// The default just removes it.
fn delete_feature(&mut self, ctx: &mut WorkbenchRuntimeContext, id: FeatureId) -> bool;

/// Which data fields are lengths and which refer to other features,
/// for the property panel.
fn property_hints(&self) -> PropertyHints;

/// Bodies that are not made (bought parts): an export of every visible
/// body and the slicer leave them out.
fn not_printed(&self, doc: &Document) -> Vec<BodyId>;

/// Bodies drawn faded while the bench is active (still pickable): what
/// a tool asks the user to see past.
fn faded_bodies(&self, ctx: &WorkbenchRuntimeContext) -> Vec<BodyId>;

/// Features of other bodies that act on `body` (a joint holding one
/// body to another); the tree lists each under `body` too, as a link.
fn linked_features(&self, doc: &Document, body: BodyId) -> Vec<FeatureId>;

/// Inputs the property panel lets the user swap (a profile sketch), and
/// how to swap one.
fn references(&self, doc: &Document, id: FeatureId, node: &FeatureNode)
    -> Vec<FeatureReference>;
fn set_reference(&mut self, ctx: &mut WorkbenchRuntimeContext, id: FeatureId,
    key: &str, to: ReferenceChoice) -> Result<(), String>;
```

A click on a feature in the tree only selects it: it becomes the active
document object. A double click switches to its owner and calls
`edit_feature`, which is where the workbench opens the feature's task; never
open one on selection alone. `editing_feature` names the feature under
edit (the tree badges it, and a feature that builds solid gets a preview);
`locks_view_to_plane` keeps the camera square to the plane while
`editing_feature` is `Some`.

## 7. Take formulas

`parameters` lists an owned feature's numbers that formulas may set and
read: a `Parameter` with a stable key, the name formulas call it, a JSON
pointer into the feature's data, a `Dim` (length, angle, number), a scale
for an angle kept in radians, and whether it is a count. The workbench
builds, draws and edits from `Document::feature_values`, which has every
formula's value in; its own data keeps plain numbers.

- `settle` makes the data whole once values are in (a sketch solves).
- `derive`, `derive_on_solid` and `derive_on_geometry` bring working data
  up to what it follows: another feature, what the last build found of the
  solid (`BuildPlan::probes`), the bodies' geometry. All are derived and
  never recorded.
- `values_moved` records results that follow formulas but are kept rather
  than derived (placements a joint solves for), in the same undo step.

## 8. Build solids

A workbench whose features make a body's solid implements:

```rust
/// Bodies to rebuild now, each with a plan. Called every frame.
/// Clear the dirty flags of the planned features here, or the same job
/// comes back next frame.
fn rebuild_jobs(&self, doc: &mut Document) -> Vec<RebuildJob>;

/// The body's history changed: rebuild it from the start.
fn invalidate_body(&self, doc: &mut Document, body: BodyId);

/// Every solid is out of date (undo, redo, Recompute All).
fn invalidate_all(&self, doc: &mut Document);
```

A `BuildPlan` is a list of `kernel_api::SolidOp`s (`ops`) with the feature
that made each one (`op_features`); the application runs it on the kernel
worker, and a kernel failure is shown on the feature whose op failed. A
feature that cannot be planned stops the plan: put its `BuildError` in
`failed` and the features after it in `unbuilt`, and the body shows the
history before it. `probes` asks the solid questions part way through (where
a face a sketch stands on is now); the answers come back through
`derive_on_solid`. A job whose plan is `Err(BuildError)` puts the error on its
feature and builds nothing; an empty plan drops the body's derived solid.

## 9. Add menu entries

```rust
fn menu_items(&self, scope: &MenuScope, doc: &Document) -> Vec<MenuItem>;
fn on_command(&mut self, id: &str, scope: &MenuScope, ctx: &mut WorkbenchRuntimeContext) -> bool;
```

The scopes are the right-click menu on a body, a feature, body or
component row in the tree, the Edit menu (`edit.cut`, `edit.copy`,
`edit.paste` on the active workbench), and the start page. A start page
item becomes a New card. Its command runs in a fresh document with one
body.

## 10. Ask the host for things

Every hook that acts gets a `WorkbenchRuntimeContext`: the document, the
camera and viewport, hover and selection (`selected_faces`,
`selected_edges`, `selected_face_in(body)` for a body's own frame), the
active document object, the kernel's queries (`kernel`), the colours to
draw in (`sketch_palette`), projection helpers, and logging (`log_info` and
others).

Anything else goes through a request:

```rust
ctx.request(HostRequest::ActivateTool("mine.select".into()));
ctx.request(HostRequest::SelectBody(body));
ctx.request(HostRequest::JournalLabel("Create thing".into()));
ctx.request(HostRequest::StartOn { workbench: WorkbenchId::from("wb.sketch"), attach });
ctx.request(HostRequest::SwitchWorkbench(WorkbenchId::from("wb.design")));
ctx.request(HostRequest::OrientCamera(CameraOrientRequest { .. }));
ctx.request(HostRequest::FinishEditing);
ctx.request(HostRequest::SaveFile { name, kind, extension, contents });
```

The host applies requests after the method returns, collected with
everything else the hook left (`HookOutcome`). Requests from
`on_activate` and `on_deactivate` that switch workbench are ignored, since
those run during a switch. `StartOn` switches workbench and passes `attach`
to the new one as `ctx.attach_request`.

## 11. Draw panels

- `task()` opens the task panel on the right; `ui_task_panel` draws it and
  handles OK and Cancel. One task is one undo step, unless its `TaskInfo`
  is `stepwise` (the sketcher's session, where each edit is a step).
- `ui_left_panel` draws above the model tree.
- `viewport_hud` and `status_items` fill the viewport corners and the
  status bar.
- `get_overlay_meshes` and `get_screen_space_overlays`, `_images`,
  `_marks` and `_labels` draw over the scene while the workbench is active.
- `clip_plane` cuts the scene at a plane of any direction while it returns
  one (the sketcher's section view), in drawing and picking alike, standing
  in for the view toolbar's clipping plane.
- `ui_settings` draws the workbench's page in Preferences; `has_settings`
  returning true is what gives it a place there. A bench with nothing to
  set leaves both alone and gets no page. `settings_json` and
  `apply_settings_json` keep its settings in the user's file.
- `suspend_session` and `resume_session` hand the host the editing state
  that belongs to the document on screen, so each tab keeps its own.
- `busy` keeps frames coming while work of the workbench runs away from
  the window.

## Checklist

1. `descriptor` with `icon` and `feature_kinds`, and a test that the icons
   exist.
2. `configure` with the tools and their default keys, and
   `is_tool_enabled` where tools have preconditions.
3. `feature_info`, plus `passive_geometry`, `pick_feature`,
   `delete_feature`, `property_hints`, `references` and `set_reference` as
   needed, and `parameters` for the numbers formulas may set.
4. `rebuild_jobs`, `invalidate_body` and `invalidate_all` if it builds
   solids.
5. `on_input` for the tools.
6. `edit_feature`, `editing_feature`, `task` and `ui_task_panel` for
   editing, `suspend_session`/`resume_session` for per-tab state,
   `has_settings` and `ui_settings` for preferences.
7. `menu_items` and `on_command` for menus and start cards.
8. `register_command` and `run_command` for what scripts can do, and
   `register_import` for files it reads.
9. Registration in `crates/workbenches/src/lib.rs`.

`crates/app_shell/src/app/seam_lint.rs` fails if a workbench crate, id or
feature type appears in the application, and CI checks the same. The
application builds scenes from workbench features only through
`bench_fixtures` (`crates/workbenches/fixtures`).
